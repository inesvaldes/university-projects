<h1>Mini Game panel</h1>

<p>
After confirming the reservation, the customer is rewarded with a small mini game. The game offers
the possibility of winning a 100€ voucher for the next booking.

<h2>Game description</h2>
<p>
The mini game consists of a board with five hidden cells. Only one of these cells contains a 100€
gift voucher; the others are empty or contain a losing symbol. The customer can uncover only one
cell by clicking on it once.
</p>

<h2>Elements on the screen</h2>
<ul>
    <li><b>Instructions label:</b> A short explanation of the game rules for the user.</li>
    <li><b>Game cells:</b> Five clickable cells, initially displayed with a question mark (or similar icon) to indicate
        that they are hidden.</li>
    <li><b>Result label:</b> A label informing the user whether they have won the 100€ voucher or not.</li>
    <li><b>Revealed voucher location:</b> If the player loses, the game reveals which cell contained the voucher.</li>
    <li><b>Close button:</b> Closes the mini game and returns to the Main Menu, leaving the application ready for
        the next customer.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to play</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Read the <b>instructions</b> at the top of the panel.</li>
    <li>Click on one of the five cells. Only the first click is valid; afterwards, the other cells are disabled.</li>
    <li>The selected cell is revealed:
        <ul>
            <li>If it shows a <b>voucher symbol</b> (for example, a “%” sign), the customer wins a 100€ gift voucher
                for the next booking.</li>
            <li>If it shows a <b>losing symbol</b> (for example, a cross), the customer does not win the voucher.</li>
			<h3>Hidden cell</h3>

			<h3>Winning cell</h3>

			<h3>Losing cell</h3>

        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>In case of losing, the cell that contained the voucher is revealed so that the user can see where it was.</li>
    <li>The <b>result label</b> at the bottom displays a message summarising the outcome of the game.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Effect on the booking file</h2>
<p>
If the customer wins the 100€ voucher, an additional line is added to the booking file, after the
“Offer discount” line and before “Total amount”:
</p>

<pre>
Obtained a 100€ gift voucher for your next booking
</pre>

<p>
The reservation summary itself does not have to be displayed again; it is enough that the gift is
recorded in the file.
</p>

<h2>Finishing the game</h2>
<p>
When the game is finished, the customer can click the <b>Close</b> button. This returns the application to
the <b>Main Menu</b>, with the random offer park preserved but all booking data cleared, so the system is
ready for the next client.
