<h1>Main Menu</h1>

<p>
The main menu is the starting point of the OpenWorld Agency application. From here, you can choose
whether to begin your booking with theme parks or accommodations. This panel also highlights the
theme park that is currently on special offer.

<h2>Elements on the screen</h2>

<ul>
    <li><b>Logo:</b> Displays the OpenWorld Agency brand. It is purely decorative and has no direct action.</li>
    <li><b>Application title:</b> Shows the name of the application, for example “OpenWorld Agency”.</li>
    <li><b>Special offer area:</b> A highlighted section showing that one park is on offer. All tickets and
        accommodations associated with this park have a 15% discount on the final price.</li>
    <li><b>Featured park name and image:</b> Indicates which theme park is currently on offer, including
        an image and sometimes a short description.</li>
    <li><b>Theme parks section image and button:</b> An image representing theme parks and a button
        that opens the <b>Theme Parks</b> panel.</li>
    <li><b>Accommodations section image and button:</b> An image representing accommodations and a
        button that opens the <b>Accommodations</b> panel.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How the special offer works</h2>
<p>
Each time the application is launched, one theme park is selected randomly as the offer park. This park
remains on offer throughout the entire session. All tickets and all accommodations associated with this
park receive a 15% discount on their final price. The discount will be shown explicitly in the reservation
summary if the user has booked items for that park.
</p>

<h2>How to use the Main Menu</h2>

    <li>Decide whether you want to start with <b>Theme Parks</b> (tickets) or <b>Accommodations</b>.</li>

        </ul>
